# Wikipedia Link Hopper
Returns the titles of the first link in a random Wikipedia article. Uses requests on python3

After reading about how following large percantage of Wikipedia articles' first links will lead to the Philisophy page, I threw this together for the giggles.

Some observations: 
* First links tend towards linguistics and science,
* Changing the link number to 2 makes it jump around more before settling in a "philisophy <-> science" or "latin <-> grammar" link loop,
* I am good at wasting time during final exams.
